# React Playground

A repository to hold little projects built in react. Each project is in a separate branch for easy access. All projects are built with vite react template. 

## Projects 

### 1. Directory Navigator
Renders a file directory structure with capabilities to add/remove folders and files. No actual files/folders are created. This is similar to rendering the explorer sidebar in many IDEs.
